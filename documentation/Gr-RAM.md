Graphical RAM is 200x160 pixels. Each address on the RAM is a pixel on a screen. "Every pixel is represented by a memory address. The value stored defines the color of the pixel, using a fixed color palette. There are two screen buffers implemented to support page flipping. The palette used is structured as follows: The indices 0-9 correspond to the colors white, black, red, green, blue, yellow, cyan, magenta, orange and pink. The indices 32-63 map gray values and the indices 64-127 represent 64 color values each with two bits per color channel. This results in a simple palette that can be addressed with only 7-bit. If the architecture supports a 16-bit index, from Index 0x8000, a high-color mode with 5 bits per color channel can be used, which enables 32768 colors."
